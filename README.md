### Warning:

This application and the consumed API are hosted on a free server. This means that if it's not used for a period of time, the server will shut down. This may cause a delay in the first API request. In this case, the first request is made when typing in the address input. Please be patient.

### How it works:

When using the application, you will go through a 6-step form:

- **Step 1:**
  - Welcome, you only have to have a button to start the process.
- **Step 2:**
  - First and Last name
- **Step 3:**
  - Address: It is a field that allows you to search and list the different buildings that we have in our database, these can be consulted by `name`, `city`, `address`, `postal`, `state`.
  - Apt number
- **Step 4:**
  - Select the TV plan
- **Step 5:**
